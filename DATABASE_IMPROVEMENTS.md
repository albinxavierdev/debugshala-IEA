# Database Flow Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the database flow in the DebugShala Assessment application.

## Summary of Changes

Four major improvements have been implemented:

1. **API Routes for Database Access**
   - Moved all direct database access from client-side code to server-side API routes
   - Created dedicated endpoints for user, question, and assessment operations
   - Improved security by preventing direct database access from client

2. **Schema Validation**
   - Implemented Zod for schema validation
   - Created strict type definitions for all database operations
   - Enabled validation before data reaches the database

3. **Enhanced Data Sanitization**
   - Improved security with comprehensive sanitization functions
   - Added protection against XSS, SQL injection, and other common attacks
   - Implemented recursive sanitization for complex objects

4. **Optimized Query Patterns**
   - Added selective column querying
   - Implemented proper filtering and pagination
   - Reduced data transfer with specific column selection

## API Routes Structure

### User Operations
- `GET /api/users` - Get user data with selective column filtering
- `POST /api/users` - Create or update user data

### Question Operations
- `GET /api/questions` - Get questions with type/category filtering 
- `POST /api/questions` - Save question sets to database

### Assessment Results
- `GET /api/assessment/results` - Get assessment results with pagination
- `POST /api/assessment/results` - Save assessment results

## Schema Validation

Zod schemas have been created for:
- Form data validation
- Score validation
- Question validation
- API request/response validation

## Sanitization Improvements

The sanitization system now includes:
- HTML tag removal
- Script tag removal
- Event handler removal
- SQL injection pattern detection
- Unicode control character removal
- Recursive object sanitization
- Array sanitization

## Query Optimization

Database queries now:
- Select only necessary columns
- Use proper filtering
- Apply limits for pagination
- Order results properly

## Security Benefits

These improvements provide:
- Protection against SQL injection
- Prevention of XSS attacks
- Data validation before reaching database
- Proper error handling and propagation
- Reduced attack surface by moving database operations to server

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data
2. Add rate limiting to API routes to prevent abuse
3. Consider implementing a query builder for more complex database operations
4. Add database migrations for schema changes
